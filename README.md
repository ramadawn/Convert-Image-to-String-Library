```python

def its(image, val_ord = "0", val_ord_xy = False, val_i = " ", val_type = "s", val_iol = True, 
         val_sol = 0,val_eol = None , val_pvc = 1, val_pvc_type = 'i', gs_i = ", ",

```

## Features:
Converts an image into a string with a fully customizable output string format .

## Purpose: 

The purpose of this library is to allow users to convert image files to strings with fully customizable outputs. In doing so, it will allow users to send image data to customized image interpretation software and also allow robotic visual data collecting systems to preform preprossing on the image data before it is outputted to the robot’s CPU. 

## White Space: 

Its function will add white space before each new string addition if no whitespace is to be found. For example if the Value space indicator is submitted as "(no white space)x", the string will output value(white space)x. On the other hand the Value space indicator is "(white space)x" then the output will still be Value x. Multiple white spaces will not be accounted for. So a value space indicator of "(double white space)x" will attach as Value(double white space)x.

# Function Parameters: 

**Value Space Indicator Parameters:**

Indicators seperating each individual value. 
Example: For RGB, red, green and blue would each be seperated by value space indicators.

**1) val_ord (data ordering) (val_ord = "0") :**

**(takes a string input which is converted to an integer inside of function)**

**Note: string MUST be numbers with no space between  EX: '123' , '301', '405' position range is 0 to length of tuple - 1**

(default = starts at position zero increases sequentially)  
Takes in a position value string "xyz" and compares it to the pixel values array [R,G,B] and outputs pixel list with values equal to the position value of the string. For Example if an RGB array was passed with values 201. Then the new RGB array would be B (at position 2) R (at position 0) and G (at position 1) for a final array of BRG.

The new list gets integrated into the string. So an RGB picture reordered to BGR would spit out a string with the pixels values of BRG,

Example an RGB image could be encoded as GBR or BGR etc.

activating this parameter will reduce performance speed by around 25 percent. for a 3 value array.

**this function is not limited to any particular number of values and can handle pixels with any amount of values**

value positions start from zero. So a 5 value pixel will be reordered from position 0-4.

**1a) val_ord_xy (flips x and y postions) (val_ord_xy = False) :**

(Indicated as a boolian)

If this parameter is marked as True, the value of position image x,y will be moved to postion y,x.
This task is done before val_ord so that if Val_ord and val_ord_xy are both active then the position will be moved 
and then the values will be reordered.

**2) val_i (Value Space Indicator)(val_i = “ “):**

default: whitespace (indicated as a string) **must be a string**

string = “string” , **val_type must idicate 's'; its default value**
list = must be a list of strings, **val_type must idicate 'l'**
dictionary = all values and keys in this dictionary must be strings. **val_type must idicate 'd'**

The user may define any string, list or dictionary to serve as a seperator for the image array[x,y] values 

**3) val_type (Value Space Data Type)(val_type = ’s‘):

default: ‘s’ **must be a string**

This indicates the date type of value space being used. (Indicated as a string.)

‘s’  denotes string
‘l’  denotes list
‘d’ denotes dictionary

If data type is string it will embed this string between the values of the output string. 

If the data type is a list, it will embed the values of that list (in string format) as per the instructions provided by parameter 4 ,5, 6 and 7. The list can be accessed sequentially, it can be iterated over.  It can be started at any particular position and it can skip a variable number of postions. 

Dictionary: If the value space value is a dictionary. The fuction will look up the current value in the dictionary and embed the string associated with said value in the dictionary before it is attached to the value of the string.

Example if the current value is 10. The function will look up 10 in the dictionary and if that value is “orange” it will first concatinate “orange” to the end of the output string and then it will concatinate “10” to the end of the string.



**4) val_iol ( iterate over list True or False)(val_iol = True):**

default: ‘True’ **must be a boolian**

Tells the fuction whether or not to iterate over the imput list (uses a Boolian)

If value is set to **False**. The last value of the list used will be used for all remaining Value space idicators.

If Val_sol is greater than Val_eol and val_pvc is negative then the list will read from val sol to Val_eol

**Note the fuction has not yet been tested for a Val_sol greater than Val_eol with a positive val_pvc**

**5) val_sol (start in location on list)(val_sol = 0):**

default: 0 **Must be an integer**

tells the fuction where on the list to start reading from (uses and integer)

**5a) val_eol (end in location on list) (eol = None):**

default = None **Any other value must be an integer**

tells the fuction where on the list to stop reading from (uses an integer)

if this parameter is assigned an integer. Its fuction will stop reading along the value space indicator list at this postion. It will iterate if val_iol = True. 

**6) val_pvc (position value change)(val_pvc = 1):**

default: 1 **Must be an integer**

Must be an integer; unless val_pvc_type indicates a list or a dictionary. Indicates the amount of spaces the pionter moves on the Value Type List with each iteration.

**If using a list for val_pvc you must input a list of integers (val_pvc_type = "l")**

** If using a list of val_pvc you must input a dictionary with integers for keys and Values**

The Keys for dictionaries will be compared to the last pixel value used. I.E in RGB, if the value for G is attached the val_pvc dictionary select a PVC value for G key. If no value is present the PVC return as 1 and simple move to the next entry in the Value Space indicator list. 

will increase the position of the list cursor with each read by this amout. Number may be negative. In which case the cursor will go backwards during each read. 

**7) val_pvc_type  (position value change list or dictionary)(val_pvc_type = 'i'):**

**must be a string**

default: 'i' This idicates a single integer is being used. The position value change on the space value indicator list will change by this amount with each new value added.
‘l’ = list 
‘d’ = dictionary

allows the user to input a list or dictionary for the postion value change parameter.

If parameter is a dictionary: The current value spave idicator will be used as the key for the pvc dictionary. The value at that key will be used for the next position value change on the value space indicator list.
**In order for the PVC dictionary to function it must contain the following key value pair**

{'start':(some integer)} **This will always be the first PVC integer used**

If paramter is a list: the fuction will go down the list. (iterating if nesseary) using that value as the position value change parameter.

**NOTE in both list and dictionary cases the out put value MUST be an integer while the key for the dictionary MUST be a string**

**Parameters 8, 11 to 15  do the same as above but are used to format the value group indicators. Differences as follows:**


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Group Space Indicator Parameters:

Indicators seperating each group of values.
Example: For the three values that compose the RGB value. These three values are seperates by the group space.

**8) gs_i (value group indicator)(gsi = “,”):**

default (“,”) same as parameter 2 except is used on the value group indicator **Must be a string**

**9) gsd (value group distance)(gsd = len(image[x,y]):**

default (x,y array length)

this can be modified to change the size of the image array values.
Example: [r,g,b] with a value of 4 becomes [r,g,b,x]

**10) mgs_input (Modified Group Space Array Input)(mgs_input = None):**

default: None

If the array size has been modified and this value is None then the first value in the next array location will be used.

Example If an array is RGB , Value Group Distance is 4 and this parameter is None then the string will output ‘RGBR/nGBRG/nBRGB/n’ etc

It this value is a list it will iterate down the list (repeating if nessary)  adding the value of the list to the new X position. 

If there are mulitple x positions, the fuction will look for a tuple of values at the current list position and add those values to the x position is sequence  

Example: if an RGB is given a Value Group Distance of 4, (creating a data set called RGBX), then the value of X will be the value of the currrent position on the input list. If the Value Group Distance is 5; creating an array RGBXY, then the fuction will look for a tuple(a,b) at postion n on the list and create the string output RGBAB.

If this value is a Dictionary: Then the current position on the array will be used as the dictionary key and the dictionary value(s) will be used as the x value(s).


For example, for an RGB array beimng converted into a string. These stings would concatinate onto every third position after the value of B. 

**11) gs_type (Group Space Data Type)(gs_type = ’s‘):**

default = ‘s’  (see parameter 3) works as parameter 3 except is used on the value group indicator **Must be a string**

**12) gs_iol ( Group Space Iterate Over List True or False)(gsiol = True):**

default = False (see parameter 4) works as parameter 4 except is used on the value group indicator **Must be a boolian**

**13) gs_sol (Group Space Start in Location on List)(gs_sol = 0):**

default = 0 (see parameter 5) works as parameter 5 except used on the value group indicator **Must be an integer**

**13a)gs_eol (end in location on list) (gs_eol = None):

default = None **all other values must be integers**

tells the fuction where on the list to stop reading from (uses an integer)

if this parameter is assigned an integer. Its fuction will stop reading along the value space indicator list at this postion. It will iterate if gs_iol) gs_eol (end in location on list) (gs_eol = None):

default = None

tells the fuction where on the list to stop reading from (uses an integer)

if this parameter is assigned an integer. Its fuction will stop reading along the value space indicator list at this postion. It will iterate if gs_iol = True.

**14) gs_pvc (Group Space Position Value Change)(gs_pvc = 1):**

default: 1 (see parameter 6) works as parameter 6 except used on the value group indicator **Must be an integer**

**If using a list for gs_pvc you must input a list of integers (val_pvc_type = "l")**

** If using a list of gs_pvc you must input a dictionary with strings for keys and  Integers for Values**

The Keys for dictionaries will be compared to the last group space indicator used (this will be used as the key with the associate value becoming the new Position Value Change). If no value is present the PVC return as 1 and simple move to the next entry in the Value Space indicator list. 


**15) gs_pvc_type (Group Space Position Value Change List or Dictionary)(gs_pvc_type = None):**

default: None (see parameter 7) works as parameter 7 except used on the value group indicator **Must be a string**

**18) ls_iol ( Iterate Over List True or False)(ls_iol = False):**

default = True (see parameter 4) works as parameter 4 except is used on the Line Space indicator

**19) ls_sol (Start in Location on List)(ls_sol = 0):**

default = 0 (see parameter 5) works as parameter 5 except used on the value group indicator

**19a) ls_eol (finish using list at this piont)(ls_eol = None):**

Works as parameter 5a except for Line Space Indicator List

alue 
default: 1 (see parameter 6) works as parameter 6 except used on the value group indicator

**21) ls_pvc_type (Position Value Change List or Dictionary)(ls_pvc_type = None):**
